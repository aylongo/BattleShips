# BattleShips
Final project of my Computer Science major in high school.  
I've coded an android app (in Java) in which users can play the game "Battle Ships" against the computer (The computer chooses places randomly).  
Moreover, I've coded a server side (in Python) which creates communication with the users using sockets and saves their data on a MySQL database.
